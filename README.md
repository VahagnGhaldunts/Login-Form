# Login-Form
# A login form is a user interface element commonly found on websites, applications, and systems that require users to authenticate themselves before gaining access to protected or personalized content. Its primary purpose is to collect and verify a user's credentials, typically a username or email address and a password, in order to grant or deny access to the secured area.
